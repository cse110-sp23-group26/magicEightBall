# Version Two
### Web page code
GPT-4 prompt:

    - Alright, let's move on to the Magic Eight Ball page above.
    
    - I now have a new magic eight ball pattern, its relative path is 8ball/ball_1.jpg, and its size is 1024*1024
    
    - I now have a background image, its relative path is background/background_1.jpg, and its size is 1920*1080

    - Please modify the HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT files that have been implemented above to meet my following requirements:

    - Please add the new image of the Magic 8 Ball to the webpage so that the Magic 8 Ball appears in the center. Note that my image of the magic eight ball is square, however, in my web page, I just want it to appear round, because the magic eight ball is a circle.

    - The image size of the Magic Eight Ball should change to the appropriate size. (not too large)

    - Please place the input box directly below or in the center of the Magic Eight Ball (if placed in the center, it needs to cover the picture of the Magic Eight Ball), and make the input box have certain magic, dynamics and special effects. .

    - Provides shadows for the magic eight ball and the input box.

    - Please add the background image I provided to the web page, and ask for a blurred background image (degree of blur: the closer to the magic eight ball in the center, the higher the degree of blur.)

    - The style of all the above requirements should be anime (refer to Nintendo's series of games, such as The Legend of Zelda)

Update prompt:

    - Thanks for your changes. The following are more requirements, please add these requirements to the html, css, javascript files that you have changed above:

    - Please add more special effects on or around the picture of the magic eight ball. These special effects are preferably dynamic magic style. Example: Fog flows and dissipates on the Magic Eight Ball.

    - Please add more special effects matching the magic style in the text box and Ask button entered by the user. For example: As the user types, the textbox changes dynamically. The special effect will appear when the user moves the mouse over "Ask". When the user clicks "Ask", a special effect will appear.

    - Please make the reply of the Magic Eight Ball more magical. For example: change the font color, change the font style, and let the font change dynamically.

    - Please make the background of the picture contain a certain amount of blur. Blurring degree: The closer to the eight ball, the higher the blurring degree.

    - Please make the picture background more magical and dynamic. For example: Add a dynamic effect of rain to a picture.

Update Prompt:

    - Thank you for your modification, but there are still the following problems:

    - Although you have added code related to fog, there are no special effects related to fog on the web page.

    - When I type into the text box and when I move the mouse to the "Ask" button, there is no obvious special effect, especially when I type into the text box.

    - The background image does not appear blurred.

    - The Magic 8 Ball's reply works well, but it's a bit hard to see against the background image.

### Issue

    - Special effects are slightly lacking

    - Magic Eight Ball's reply is hard to read

    - Magic 8 Ball's reply is still completely random

### Future Feature

    - Add special effects (such as fog, fire) to the picture of the magic eight ball

    - Add special effects on the user text box

    - Add special effects in the background (raindrop special effects)

    - Made the magic eight ball's reply smarter
