## Summary of the implementation of the Magic Eight Ball project

### Rough idea of the web page

**Interface Design Documents (C4 model draft)**


### What input do we accept

**Documents checked**
- check: https://c4model.com/
- check: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story
- check: https://eventmodeling.org/posts/what-is-event-modeling/

**Who are our potential users?**

**What will the user put in their input?**


### What output do we accept

**What output should we have?**

***

## Web page style design

### page style

### Rough sketch of page style

### The special effects want to add

### Interface Design Documents

Those are documents to record our design. 

(I donlt think we need to include all those in 8-ball, but we indeed need a sketch)We will initially capture "fat marker design" later extended with wireframes and high fidelity prototypes.

In future projects, those documents should be in /specs/interface/rough, /specs/interface/wireframes, /specs/interface/highfidelity

***

## Testing of the web page

**How to test the code**

**What test input should we habe**

***

## Task Assign

### What tasks we have now:

1. Design a general layout of what page should look like.
2. Add some special effects on the page, can be anything, br creative.
3. Add team info in an interactive way (click a botton on the page and it will display member names and link to our group page).
4. Add branding elements to the page (animal crossing related, static images or gifs).
5. Make repose more intellgence.
6. Test different inputs and debug. For tester, create a md file to record all the inputs you tested and report any issues you find the the md file
7. Make slides document our team's process of making this app and how AI technologies assisst us, what it can or can't do.
8. Record vodeo for the presentation using slides.
9. Code reviewer, manage this repo and pull requests


Each team member should create their own branch and work in there, after you added features please create a pull request to merge into master branch.


### Task Assign
Please write task number under your name, pick tasks that hasn't been picked by others, you can pick multiple tasks if that make sense.
