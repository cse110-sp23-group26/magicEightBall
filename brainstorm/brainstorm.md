## Summary of the implementation of the Magic Eight Ball project

### Rough idea of the web page

**Interface Design Documents (C4 model draft)**


### What input do we accept

**Documents checked**
- check: https://c4model.com/
- check: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story
- check: https://eventmodeling.org/posts/what-is-event-modeling/

**Who are our potential users?**

**What will the user put in their input?**


### What output do we accept

**What output should we have?**

***

## Web page style design

### page style

### Rough sketch of page style

### The special effects want to add

### Interface Design Documents

Those are documents to record our design. 

(I donlt think we need to include all those in 8-ball, but we indeed need a sketch)We will initially capture "fat marker design" later extended with wireframes and high fidelity prototypes.

In future projects, those documents should be in /specs/interface/rough, /specs/interface/wireframes, /specs/interface/highfidelity

***

## Testing of the web page

**How to test the code**

**What test input should we habe**

***

## Task Assign
